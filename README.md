Coffee Machine Project

Overview
This project is a simple Python-based coffee machine simulator.
It takes user input for drink selection, calculates the price
based on inserted coins, checks resources (water, milk, coffee),
and handles transactions. The machine can prepare espresso, 
latte, or cappuccino, based on the user's choice.

Features
Multiple Drinks: Choose between espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
Resource Management: The machine checks if it has enough resources (water, milk, coffee) for the selected drink.
Transaction Handling: The user inserts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), and the machine provides change if overpayment is made.
Reports: The machine can display the current status of resources and the total profit made.
Turn Off: The machine can be turned off with the "off" command.
